# Clasicos Web

## Overview  
I built the Clasicos Web with Next.js and TypeScript. It also leverages key Next.js features - automatic sitemap and `robots.txt` generation, Open Graph & Twitter Card meta tags (with proper alt texts), and custom `loading.tsx`, `not-found.tsx` & `error.tsx` files - to boost user experience, performance, and SEO.

## UI Components  
I used **HeroUI** to leverage and customize the accessible components provided by the library.

## Styling & Responsiveness  
I styled the application with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a fully responsive design.

## Forms & Validation  
- **Formik** for building and managing forms  
- **Yup** for schemaâ€‘based form validation

## Data Fetching  
- **TanStack Query** for caching and synchronizing server state  
- **Axios** for making HTTP requests to the backend API

## Articles  
It was important for me to ensure descriptive titles and meta descriptions. Articles are authored following SEO best practices and crafted to deliver the best possible user experience.  

It was essential for me to carefully select key phrases, maintain proper keyword density in the content, use `<strong>` tags appropriately, and implement internal linking.

## Deployment  
The app is deployed on **Vercel**, the platform maintained by the Next.js creators and optimized specifically for Next.js projects.
