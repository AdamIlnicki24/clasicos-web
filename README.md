# Clasicos Web

## Overview  
I built the Clasicos Web with Next.js and TypeScript. It also leverages key Next.js features - automatic sitemap and `robots.txt` generation, Open Graph & Twitter Card meta tags (with proper alt texts), and custom `loading.tsx`, `not-found.tsx` & `error.tsx` files - to boost user experience, performance, and SEO.

## UI Components  
I used **HeroUI** to leverage and customize the accessible components provided by the library.

## Styling & Responsiveness  
I styled the application with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a fully responsive design.

## Forms & Validation  
- **Formik** for building and managing forms  
- **Yup** for schema‑based form validation

## Data Fetching  
- **TanStack Query** for caching and synchronizing server state  
- **Axios** for making HTTP requests to the backend API

## Articles  
Ensuring descriptive titles and meta descriptions was a top priority. Articles are authored following SEO best practices and crafted to deliver the best possible user experience.  

Selecting key phrases carefully, maintaining proper keyword density, using `<strong>` tags appropriately, and implementing internal linking helps guide both users and search engines.  

Additionally, I leverage Next.js’s `generateStaticParams` method to predefine dynamic routes at build time, boosting performance and reducing server load.

## Deployment  
The app is deployed on **Vercel**, the platform maintained by the Next.js creators and optimized specifically for Next.js projects.
